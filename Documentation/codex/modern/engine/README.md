# Modern Engine Notes

This folder documents intended modern engine internals. It is separate from
`Documentation/codex/legacy/engine/`, which describes the current architecture
and compatibility quirks.

Current implementation notes:

- `basecmd-migration-guide.md`: how the legacy `BaseCmd_*` registry should move
  toward `src/engine/commands/` without changing the public C surface.
- `command-buffer-migration-guide.md`: how raw `Cbuf_*` buffer mechanics route
  through the private modern command-buffer primitive while dispatch policy
  stays in `cmd.c`.
- `hash-checksum-migration-guide.md`: how public `crclib` compatibility exports
  should delegate into `src/utilities` without making hash/checksum helpers
  engine-owned.
- `info-string-migration-guide.md`: how the legacy `Info_*` API now routes
  through `src/engine/info_string.*` while keeping C callers stable.
- `string-path-migration-guide.md`: how public `crtlib` path helpers route
  through `src/utilities/path.*` while keeping C callers stable.
